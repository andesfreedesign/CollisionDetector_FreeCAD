# CollisionDetector_FreeCAD
A macro to find collisions between a set of objects and display them in FreeCAD

# Clarification
This tool belongs to the Animate workbench developed by Jiří VALÁŠEK

I only modified a few lines of code to adapt the CollisionDetector tool to a macro, since I think it is a great tool, and I consider it essential to use it in any assembly workbench in FreeCAD.
