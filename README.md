# CollisionDetector_FreeCAD
A macro to find collisions between a set of objects and display them in FreeCAD

# Clarification
This tool belongs to the Animate workbench developed by Jiří VALÁŠEK

https://github.com/JiriValasek/Animate

Unfortunately he doesn't have time to dedicate to his development.

I only modified a few lines of code to adapt the CollisionDetector tool to a macro, since I think it is a great tool, and I consider it essential to use it in any assembly workbench in FreeCAD.

### How to use

- Copy the files to the Macro folder
- Run the CollisionDetector file (In FreeCAD select the menu Macros...>> CollisionDetector.py
